What I learned-I have learned how to create a network and act as many different factors in said netwrok such as the gateway and the dhcp server. I have also been able to access others virtual machones within the created network and communicate with all on said network.
What went well-It was fairly easy to get eveyones vm connected to the network and to make sure we were all completing the tasks we neded to get done.
What didnt go so well- There was only a few minor problems that were mainly caused by small unseeable syntax errors that needed double checking. Apart from these problems the process has gone rather smoothly.
How could I get better at this topic-I will continue completing the task and learning and sharpening my skills in networking and creating servers and networks.
