What I learnt-How to curl to other computers and ping them on a network and link up the computers.
What went well-We ended up being able to ping each other and run our apps and get a connection to the server and each others apps using a curl command.
We also configured our firewalls to only allow data from each other and not from anywhere else.
What didnt go so well-Yet again the longer commands can become finnicky and easy to get wrong or misspell 
How can I get better at this-Keep practicing and look into more ways and methids and keep them fresh in my mind
