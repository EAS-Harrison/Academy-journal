What I learnt-The basics of a client server and how it uses DNS servers and SMTPs to communicate with external computers.
What went well-As a team we managed to create an accurate diagram that we could easily understand and explain to others.
What didnt go so well-Not much, it went pretty smoothly it was just the research part that took a while due to how specific we had to be with our diagram.
How can I improve my knowledge in this subject-I can research it in my own time an familiarise myself with the client server process more.
