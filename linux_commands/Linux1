What I learnt-How to create and alter folders and files within the terminal using only linux commands.
How to git add, commit and push the new informatoin to my remote repository
The basic and intermideate commads that can navigate and add to your files.
What went well- I completed the task relatively smoothly.I can now git pushg to succession without too many errors
I am able to complete this task on my own.
What didnt go so well-Initially I found it hard and confusing.
I kept finding issues with finalizing the git push and keeping up to date with my remote repository.
How can I improve my knowledge in this subject-I could research the commands and make sure I keep this all fresh in my mind as I have been doing.
